                    Today, we're going to embark on an exciting journey into the world of diphthongs and digraphs.<br> 

                    These are two special members of the alphabet family that work together to create unique and fascinating sounds.<br>

                    Let's start with <span style="color: rgb(172, 74, 194);">diphthongs</span>.<br> 

                    It's a funny word, isn't it? Diphthongs are like friendly duos – they're made up of two vowel sounds that join forces to create a single, smooth sound.<br>

                    It's like a vowel party happening right in your mouth!<br>

                    Now, let's talk about <i>digraphs</i>. These are groups of two letters that make a single, special sound. It's like they're best friends who always stick together.
